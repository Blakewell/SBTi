.. py:class:: PortfolioCoverageTVP(config: Type[PortfolioCoverageTVPConfig] = PortfolioCoverageTVPConfig)

   Bases: :class:`SBTi.portfolio_aggregation.PortfolioAggregation`

   Lookup the companies in the given portfolio and determine whether they have a SBTi approved target.

   :param config: A class defining the constants that are used throughout this class. This parameter is only required
                   if you'd like to overwrite a constant. This can be done by extending the PortfolioCoverageTVPConfig
                   class and overwriting one of the parameters.

   .. method:: _get_target_status(self, company: pd.Series)


      Get the target status (Target set, Committed or No target) as it's known to the SBTi for a certain row out of
      the company data dataframe.

      :param company: The company data
      :return: The SBTi status of the target


   .. method:: get_portfolio_coverage(self, company_data: pd.DataFrame, portfolio_aggregation_method: PortfolioAggregationMethod)


      For each of the companies, get the status of their target (Target set, Committed or No target) as it's known to
      the SBTi. Matching will be done primarily on the company ID (ASIN) and secondary on the company name.

      :param company_data: The company as it is returned from the data provider's get_company_data call.
      :param portfolio_aggregation_method: PortfolioAggregationMethod: The aggregation method to use
      :return: The aggregated score
